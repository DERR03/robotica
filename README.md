      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        The most difficult problem encountered is a femur fracture, which involves the complete break of the longest, strongest, and most vital bone for the human body's mobility.
        When a person suffers a femur fracture, they not only lose the ability to walk or support themselves, but may also face serious complications such as infections, blood clots, or damage to important vessels.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-4">Treatment & Recovery</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Furthermore, treatment is much more complex, as it generally requires surgery to insert screws, nails, or metal plates.
        Recovery can be long and painful, often including months of intensive physical therapy to restore mobility and strength.
